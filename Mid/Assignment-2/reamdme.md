## Assignment-2 Activation Functions

An activation function is a mathematical function that is applied to the output of a neural network's hidden layer to introduce nonlinearity. Activation functions are crucial for neural networks to learn complex patterns in data. They allow the network to model nonlinear relationships between inputs and outputs, making it capable of solving more complex problems.

The purpose of this function is to transform the input signal into an output signal that can be more easily interpreted by the next layer in the network. Without activation functions, neural networks would be limited to only linear transformations, which are not sufficient for many real-world applications. Here, the following activation function will be discussed in detail and implemented.
